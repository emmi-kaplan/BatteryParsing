# BatteryParsing
Battery Parsing interview question 


For this problem, we’re going to have you parse data from a battery cycler. The goal is to see how charge
capacity and discharge capacity change over 302 cycles of the battery.
For each half cycle (either a charge or discharge), you should pull out the maximum capacity. Here are
approximate values for the first cycles. You don’t need to get these exactly.
Cycle Number Charge Capacity Discharge Capacity
1 148 158
2 162 160
3 162 141
4 144 142
5 143 142
6 143 141
7 143 142
8 143 142
9 142 141
10 142 140
11 141 140

The data file is battery_parsing_question.txt. It is a text file with some number of header rows followed by
a data table. The data table is tab separated.
The columns that you should look at are
Half Cycle, Cycle Number, Capacity/ma.h.
The idea is that each number we want you
to extract is capacity of a given half cycle
which is usually the last value of capacity
before the next half cycle.
The goal at the end is to be able to
produce a graph like the one to the right
that shows the battery capacity over all of
the cycles.
We’re looking for clean, well-written code
to parse the file and extract the relevant
data to make the graph. We also want you
to be asking clarification questions and
make sure you’re understanding the
problem correctly.
